# What is string manipulation 


.box[
- the process of handling and analyzing strings;

- As we recall, string is a one element character vector and that you can create strings with either single quotes or double quotes
]

```{r comment='#'}
string1 <- "This is a really simple string: less is more"
string2 <- "If you want to include a 'quote' inside a string, please use single quotes"
```

.box[
- It comprises of various string parsing and manipulation techniques that can be used to extract text patterns, modify strings and 
data wrangling

- Most data in the digital world contains text, and hence, preparing such data for analysis requires significant amount of string 
manipulation techniques

# String manipulation in R

.box[
- base R provides very limited string manipulation capabilities;

- Stringr package provides cohesive set of most important and commonly used functions to make string manipulation easy and straight forward

- Stringr is built on top of stringi - which contains comprehensive set of all string manipulation functions imaginable
]

# Let's see some .red[examples]!

# String manipulation in R

Let us consider the following example string:


```{r comment='#'}
example_string <- "4 seasons - fall, winter, spring and summer!"
```

---
class: small-code
# String manipulation in R

Let us consider the following example string:

```{r comment='#'}
example_string <- "4 seasons - fall, winter, spring and summer!"
```

What if we want to detect and/or locate a pattern in our example string?

```{r comment='#'}
str_detect(example_string, "fall") #detect presence of a pattern

str_locate(example_string, "fall") #locate the pattern

str_count(example_string, "s") #count all pattern matches
```

---
class: small-code
# String manipulation in R

Let us consider the following example string:

```{r comment='#'}
example_string <- "4 seasons - fall, winter, spring and summer!"
```

Maybe we want to subset a part of the string:

```{r comment='#'}
str_sub(example_string, start = 13, end = 16) #extract substrings

str_extract(example_string, "win") #extract first pattern match

str_extract_all(example_string, "a")
```

---
class: small-code
# String manipulation in R

Let us consider the following example string:

```{r comment='#'}
example_string <- "4 seasons - fall, winter, spring and summer!"
```

Another important function in data wrangling is string modification:

```{r comment='#'}
str_replace(example_string, pattern = "summer",replacement = "holidays") #replace pattern with another

str_to_upper(example_string, locale = "en") #converts everything to upper case

unlist(str_split(example_string, "and")) #splits a string into substrings
```

---
class: small-code
# String manipulation in R

Let us consider the following example string:

```{r comment='#'}
example_string <- "4 seasons - fall, winter, spring and summer!"
```

Some other fun string manipulation techniques are:

```{r comment='#'}
str_length(example_string) #returns the length of the string

str_c(example_string, "AND SNOW!", sep = "") #joins multiple strings into one

str_dup("RUN!", 3) #repeats string n times
```

#String manipulation in R
##Regular Expressions and Stringr

.box[
Regular Expressions are a concise language used to define patterns in strings.
We can used stringr functions by programming naive matching algorithms using Regular Expressions.
]

Consider the following example: The regular expression "[aeiou]" finds a match for any single character that is a vowel.

```{r comment='#'}
string_vector <- c("why", "do", "we", "use", "regular", "expressions") #define new vector

str_subset(string_vector, "[aeiou]") #extract all strings with vowel in them
```

#Summary

#Summary
.box[
- In the world of internet, string manipulation makes working with web data extremely important.

- Text files and text data make up for a lot of information we process and analyze, highlighting the importance of string manipulation

- Base R has some functions to work with strings, however, stringr makes it much easier to analyze strings

- In cases of approximate pattern matching, regular expressions can be used alongwith stringr to conduct data analysis

#Quick Test

Let us consider the following string:
```{r comment='#'}
planets_string <- c("mars", "uranus", "venus", "saturn", "pluto - yes some people still consider me a planet")
```

.box[Which function can we use to find out  which planet has the longest name or contains more strings?

- str_count

- str_length

- str_summary()]


.box[How would you replace the symbol “-” for a “,”? 

- str_mutate(planets_string, "-", ",")

- str_replace(planets_string, ",", "-") 

- str_replace(planets_string, "-", ",")]

---
class: small-code
#Quick Test

```{r comment='#'}
planets_string <- c("mars", "uranus", "venus", "saturn", "pluto - yes some people still consider me a planet")
```

.box[How would you detect which planet contains more information than just its name?

- str_detect(planets_string, "whitespace")

- str_detect(planets_string, " ") 

- str_find(planets_string, " ")
]

Welcome!`r emo::ji("smile")` For this session we're going to work with the **stringr** package (make sure you have installed it!) and **regex**. This package is designed to manipulate *strings*, recall that you can create them with either single quotes or double quotes.

Check stringr documentation: https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/from-base.html#order-strings-1

```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'If you want to include a "quote" inside a string, please use single quotes'
```

## String manipulation basics

We will work with a simple list of dog breeds `r emo::ji("dog")` `r emo::ji("heart")`

```{r}
dogs_data <- c("Border Collie","Akita","Labrador","Poodle","Miniature Schnauzer","Fox Terrier","Tibetan Mastiff")  
```

1. Which is the **dog breed with the longest name** in the list? Please calculate it and sum the string length in the entire list.

```{r}

str_length(dogs_data)

sum(str_length(dogs_data)) #If you need to know the lenght of the entire list, you can just use sum()


```

2. Are you sure that you got the right number? `r emo::ji("thinking")`*Hint: beware of whitespaces*

```{r}

str_length(str_replace_all(dogs_data," ",""))

```

3. Please indicate which breeds contain an **"a"** in its name.

```{r}

str_subset(dogs_data, "a")

```

4. Did you realized that it only returns the breeds written in **lowercase**? Find a way to convert all breeds to lowercase and repeat the previous step. 

```{r}

str_subset(str_to_lower(dogs_data), 'a')

```

5. Look for the position of breeds with an **uppercase "I"** but make sure that it takes into account all breeds.

```{r}

str_subset(str_to_upper(dogs_data), 'I')

```

6. Count the number of **"t" letters** in the list.

```{r}

str_count(dogs_data, "t")

```

7. Replace with an exclamation the **first "a"** in each breed. *Hint: beware of lower and uppercases.*

```{r}

str_replace(str_to_lower(dogs_data), "a", "!")

```

8. Pick **Miniature Schnauzers** and retrieve the second part of the name using str_sub().

```{r}

str_sub(str_subset(dogs_data, "schnauzer"), 11, 19)

```

## Manipulating sentences

```{r}
```

9. You can also work with sentences and convert string to **sentence**. Use this sentence *"  schnauzers were Originally Bred to be ratters, guard Dogs,     and All-purpose Dogs On German farms."*

```{r}

str_to_sentence("  schnauzers were Originally Bred to be ratters, guard Dogs,     and All-purpose Dogs On German farms.")

```

10. The sentence looks better, but we still have some **white spaces** in between it. Please trim it.

```{r}

str_trim("  Schnauzers were originally bred to be ratters, guard dogs,     and all-purpose dogs on german farms.") 


```

11. Some **white spaces** in between are still there, please remove them as well.

```{r}

str_squish("  Schnauzers were originally bred to be ratters, guard dogs,     and all-purpose dogs on german farms.")

```

12. Now we actually want that **white space back**, but we only need it at the beginning and end of it.

```{r}

str_pad("Schnauzers don't bite", width = 60, side="both") 


```

## Using RegEx

**Regular expressions**, or **regexps**, are a concise language for describing patterns in strings.
(/Users/elena/Documents/Hertie MPP/2nd Year/Data Science/regexpic)

Check this useful **cheat sheet**:
https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/elena/Documents/Hertie MPP/2nd Year/Data Science/regexpic.png")        
```
### The next list contains words with some **pronunciations and typos**. Our task is to standarize all the names and remove useless puntuations. 
```{r}

dogs_data <- c("Border Collie", "akita!", "LABRADOR", "Poodle.", "miniature schnauzer", "FOX TERRIER", 
"Tibetan Mastiff")
```

13. Remove **punctuations** to standarize the list and save it as a new object called *"clean_list"*.

```{r}

clean_list <- str_replace_all(dogs_data, "[:punct:]","")

```

14. We want to rewrite all breeds in a **nice format**, use the previously saved object (clean_list), in which only the first letter is **uppercased**.

```{r}

str_to_title(clean_list)

```

### Now we will work a list containing the number of dogs by breed and the last year they were counted.

```{r}
dog_count <- c("Border Collie 23 2019", "Akita 11 2020", "Labrador 24 2021", "Poodle 1 2017", "Miniature Schnauzer 80 2018", "Fox Terrier 5 2009", "Tibetan Mastiff 6 2010")
```
15. In which position is the **first number** in the strings? Please locate it.
```{r}

str_locate(dog_count, '\\d') # '\\d' detects digits in strings

```
16. In which position are **all the numbers** in the strings? Please locate it.
```{r}

str_locate_all(dog_count, '\\d') # '\\d' detects digits in strings

```
17. Let's use regex to extract the **quantity of dogs by breed**. We first need to locate numbers in the list
```{r}

str_extract(dog_count, '\\d+') # '\\d+' detects 1 or more digits in strings

```
18. Let's use regex to extract the **quantity and year** of the last counting of dogs by breed. We first need to locate numbers in the list
```{r}

str_extract_all(dog_count, '\\d+') # '\\d+' detects 1 or more digits in strings

```

### We will now use a list that contains the same info the the previous one, but the count of number of dogs is preceded by an **underscore**. 

```{r}
dog_count_pattern <- c("Border Collie_23", "Akita_11", "Labrador_24", "Poodle_1", "Miniature Schnauzer_80", "Fox Terrier_3", "Tibetan Mastiff_6")
```

19. Split the **name** and the **quantity** of dogs using str_split().

```{r}

str_split(dog_count_pattern, "_")

```

20. Sometimes it is useful the check the data in a character **matrix format**. Please provide a matrix showing breeds and count of dogs. *Hint: take into account that we only have 2 elements.*

```{r}

str_split_fixed(dog_count_pattern, "_", 2)

```

21. Detect breeds whose name is composed of **2 words** and return a logical vector (TRUE, FALSE).

```{r}

str_detect(dog_count_pattern, " ")
str_detect(dog_count_pattern, "[:space:]") #using regex

```

```{r}

doggos_pic <- ("https://i.imgflip.com/4/4t0m5.jpg")

meme(doggos_pic, upper = (" \n very [:punct:]"), lower = ("             \n      so many strings                                         \n wow data science "), size = 1, color = "green", font = "Helvetica", vjust = 0.7, r = 0.15, density = NULL)
